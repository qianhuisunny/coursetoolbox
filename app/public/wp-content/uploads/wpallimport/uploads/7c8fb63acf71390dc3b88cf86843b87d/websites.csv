Durable,https://durable.co/,"Durable.co 

Gabrielle’s take: 
Durable is suitable for small business owners/solopreneurs who want an all-in-one workspace for different parts of the business (website, CRM, payment and invoicing, marketing, customer support).  

Its AI features enable users to quickly create a website, auto-respond to form inquiries, auto-create and publish blog posts, and write ad copies. 

The team has an aggressive roadmap that they want to make owning a business easier than having a job where all of the core functions - business formation, bank account, insurance, marketing automation, tax and accounting, recruiting, payroll, and more - are solved in a few clicks. https://durable.co/blog/series-a
