<span class=""a-text-bold""><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/ABCs-How-Learn-Scientifically-Approaches/dp/0393709264/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18CQI17BO0HRD&amp;keywords=the+abcs+of+how+we+learn&amp;qid=1667849735&amp;sprefix=the+abcs+of+how+%2Caps%2C336&amp;sr=8-1"">The ABCs of How We Learn</a> was selected as one of NPR's Best Books of 2016, this book offers <strong>superior learning tools</strong> for teachers and students, <strong>from A to Z. </strong></span>

An explosive growth in<strong> learning sciences research</strong> on how people learn has revealed many ways to improve teaching and catalyze learning at all ages. The purpose of this book is to present this new <strong>science of learning</strong> so that educators can creatively translate the science into exceptional practice.
<h2>Recommended to Instructional Designers, Anyone Who Wants to Learn Learning Sciences</h2>
The book is highly appropriate for the preparation and professional development of <strong>teachers and college faculty</strong>, but also <strong>parents, trainers, instructional designers, psychology students,</strong> and simply curious folks interested in improving their own learning.
<h2>Learning Sciences</h2>
Based on a popular Stanford University course, <span class=""a-text-italic"">The ABCs of How We Learn</span> uses a novel format that is suitable as both a textbook and a popular read. With everyday language, engaging examples, a sense of humor, and solid evidence,<strong> it describes 26 unique ways that students learn.</strong>

Each chapter offers a concise and approachable breakdown of one way people learn, how it works, how we <span class=""a-text-italic"">know</span> it works, how and when to use it, and what mistakes to avoid. The book presents learning research in a way that educators can creatively translate into exceptional lessons and classroom practice.

The book covers field-defining<strong> learning theories</strong> ranging from behaviorism (R is for Reward) to cognitive psychology (S is for Self-Explanation) to social psychology (O is for Observation). The chapters also introduce lesser-known theories exceptionally relevant to practice, such as arousal theory (X is for eXcitement). Together the theories, evidence, and strategies from each chapter can be combined endlessly to create original and effective learning plans and the means to know if they succeed.
<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The author is the Dean of Stanford Graduate School of Education, <a href=""https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/danls"">Daniel L. Schwartz.</a> Unlike most books in the field of learning science/cognitive science that cite a lot of research, this book is written in plain language and is very easy to reference by using one letter for one learning theory.</p>
