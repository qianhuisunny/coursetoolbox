2369,"Rank Math SEO","My take:
Having used Yoast SEO and All-in-One SEO, both are great products, I finally settled with Rank Math SEO Pro to be my SEO tool.

(1)Aesthetic user interface, better UI than most competitors, (2)Cheaper price with access to most needed features, like AI content writer, built-in SEO checklist compatible with WordPress editor, intuitive reporting dashboard,

What this tool does:
You can see the full list of Rank Math features here https://rankmath.com/wordpress/plugin/seo-suite/

The tools I find most helpful: 
(1) SEO score on each post/page
I like that they provide prone-to-neglect SEO tips in the format of a checklist. Though I don’t always follow their suggestions nor try to get 100/100, appreciate it giving me a list of things to improve on. It also shows a Google research results preview on the right hand side. 
 
(2) Track your ranking on Google/against competitors
Most SEO tools do not have such a feature - but it is an important one! Business owners need to purchase additional tools to obtain this information, like SE Ranking. 

(3) Import Schema Markup from Other Websites

Sometimes when I see a website/page I love, I’d always be curious about what schema it uses, like this one below: 
 For myself, the Article Schema, FAQ Schema, HowTo Schema, are all great ways to let your content take up more space, and be more searchable on Google.
 
(4) Automated Image SEO

Image SEO is a powerful but often overlooked technique to generate traffic. Rank Math puts image SEO on autopilot by automatically adding ALT and Title attributes to all your images. Rank Math doesn’t even change your posts to achieve this. The tags are added on the fly when the post is viewed by the user.

The full list of features is available here. Rank Math SEO team is still working hard to enable more things. If you were using another SEO tool, like Yost, you could use Yoast Free & Premium Advanced Options Importer to import all your settings to Rank Math!
