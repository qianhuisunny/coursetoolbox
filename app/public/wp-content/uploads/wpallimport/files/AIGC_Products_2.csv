Adobe Firefly,https://firefly.adobe.com/,"Adobe Firefly is a powerful visual content creation tool offered by Adobe. It integrates seamlessly with Adobe Express in the browser. 
Several noteable features include: (1) Text-to-image generator (Current free of charge, Jan 2024); (2) Text-to-vector image (working with Adobe Illustrator); (3) Text to template (If you are an Adobe Express user)
As a long-time market leader in image processing, Adobe Firefly as many noteable features. Take text-to-image generator for example, it allows generative fill (use a brush to remove objects, or paint in new ones from text descriptions), match image style by uploading an existing image for the model to learn from, and recolor selected areas using generative prompts.

The Firefly text-to-image tool isn't available as a standalone product, it's built into Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription. You can create a Creative Cloud account for free, but you'll be limited to just 25 images per month. If you want more ""generative image credits"" from Adobe to create more Firefly images, you'll have to subscribe. 

The full-featured version of Creative Cloud costs $55 a month and comes with Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Express, Lightroom and several other tools. That gets you 1,000 Firefly creations per month. Narrower subscriptions, like Photoshop at only  $21 a month, gets you 500 AI-generated images. You can also pay $5 a month to get 100 creations, for example if you just want to use Firefly with no other Adobe tools (or if you blow through your usage cap).

Duplicate Post",https://wordpress.org/plugins/copy-delete-posts/,"My take:

Duplicate Post is a useful, free WordPress plugin. It enables you to duplicate pages/posts to make short work of using again the same elements you repeatedly use (e.g. text paragraphs, images, video, featured image, etc.)

Rank Math SEO,https://rankmath.com/,"My take:
Having used Yoast SEO and All-in-One SEO, both are great products, I finally settled with Rank Math SEO Pro to be my SEO tool.

(1)Aesthetic user interface, better UI than most competitors, (2)Cheaper price with access to most needed features, like AI content writer, built-in SEO checklist compatible with WordPress editor, intuitive reporting dashboard,

What this tool does:
You can see the full list of Rank Math features here https://rankmath.com/wordpress/plugin/seo-suite/

The tools I find most helpful: 
(1) SEO score on each post/page
I like that they provide prone-to-neglect SEO tips in the format of a checklist. Though I don’t always follow their suggestions nor try to get 100/100, appreciate it giving me a list of things to improve on. It also shows a Google research results preview on the right hand side. 
 
(2) Track your ranking on Google/against competitors
Most SEO tools do not have such a feature - but it is an important one! Business owners need to purchase additional tools to obtain this information, like SE Ranking. 

(3) Import Schema Markup from Other Websites

Sometimes when I see a website/page I love, I’d always be curious about what schema it uses, like this one below: 
 For myself, the Article Schema, FAQ Schema, HowTo Schema, are all great ways to let your content take up more space, and be more searchable on Google.
 
(4) Automated Image SEO

Image SEO is a powerful but often overlooked technique to generate traffic. Rank Math puts image SEO on autopilot by automatically adding ALT and Title attributes to all your images. Rank Math doesn’t even change your posts to achieve this. The tags are added on the fly when the post is viewed by the user.

The full list of features is available here. Rank Math SEO team is still working hard to enable more things. If you were using another SEO tool, like Yost, you could use Yoast Free & Premium Advanced Options Importer to import all your settings to Rank Math!
